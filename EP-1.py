    The premise of this escape game is very simple:
interact with objects in the correct order.
Objects are in brackets like this: [tree]
    You would type “tree” to interact with the tree.
Your character is smart, he can figure out what objects to use 
if he has the correct ones.
Foxes are clever like that. E;)

other commands:
besides object names, you can use these other commands too.
[look]: this clears the screen. the image and the room description
will be shown again as well. Neat! E:D
[inventory]: shows the inventory.
